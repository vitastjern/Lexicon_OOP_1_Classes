# Create an abstract class called Vehicle that should have abstract 
# methods drive and refuel. 
# Create2 vehicles that inherit the Vehicle class (a Car and a Truck) 
# and simulates driving and refueling them. Car and Truckboth have 
# fuel_quantity, fuel_consumption in liters per km and can be driven a 
# given distance: drive(distance) and refueled with a given amount of 
# fuel: refuel(fuel). It is summer, so both vehicles use air conditioners 
# and their fuel consumption per km when driving is increased by 0.9 
# liters for the carand with 1.6 liters for the truck. Also, the Truck has 
# a tiny hole in its tank and when itâ€™s refueled it keeps only 95% of the 
# given fuel. The car has no problems and adds all the given fuel to its 
# tank. If a vehicle cannot travel the given distance, its fuel does not 
# change.
